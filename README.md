# CPE212-Project05
I plan on adding a new hero class called the Gambler. The Gambler will have a basic attack that does a flat amount of damage, and a special attack that has a chance to do either high damage, varied amount of damage, or miss entirely. The gambler's attribute will be called luck, which modifies the rate of sucesses.

New gambler.cpp and gambler.hpp files will be required. 
A new entity will needed to be added to the database.json.
I plan to name the new entity Jeremy the Greedy Grinner.
Jeremy will have 7 HP, race be Goblin, have a luck of 7, and have a base weapon damage of 4.
